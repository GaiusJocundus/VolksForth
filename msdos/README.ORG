* How to meta-compile a new kernel

  After making changes the the Forth kernel source in =kernel.fb=,
  restart =volksforth.com= to have a clean system and compile a new
  "minimal" kernel with =include kernel.fb=. This will create a new
  =FORTH.COM= executable.

* creating a minimal system with a simple editor

  Execute =forth.com include minimal.sys= to generate the file
  =minimal.com= which contains a minimal VolksForth system with the
  Retro-Forth editor
  https://fossil.forth-ev.de/volksforth/wiki?name=Atari8bit-retrofortheditor

  This system can be used to edit the file =volksforth.sys= or other
  Forth source block files needed to create a full VolksForth system.

* creating a full VolksForth system from the minimal kernel

  Execute =forth.com include volks4th.sys= to create a new fully
  equipped VolksForth executable =volks4th.com=.
