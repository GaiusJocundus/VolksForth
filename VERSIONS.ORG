*3.9.6*

 * Removes all known dependencies of the X16 VolksForth kernel on
 undocumented X16 Kernal variables and thus (hopefully) on specific

 * Starts an English translation of the original German manual with a
 translation of the chapter on the multitasker. 

*3.9.5*

  X16Edit, and with some DOS and file support (DIR, CAT, DOS).

*3.9.3*

 * load, thru, +load, +thru were removed from the v4th versions
 like the x16 version that don't have block/buffer disk access.

*3.9.2*
